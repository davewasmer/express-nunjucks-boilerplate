It is a\ndirect port of the Python-powered [jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)\ntemplating engine and aims to be feature-complete with jinja2.\n\nIt was born out of frustration with other javascript templating\nengines. The most popular ones either are ugly and don't abstract\nenough (EJS) or have too different of a syntax (Jade).\n\nThe only other project like this is\n[jinjs](https://github.com/ravelsoft/node-jinjs), which seems to have\nbeen abandoned. The code is also not Javascript, but Coco, is\ndifficult to work on, has bugs, and is missing features. Nunjucks\nhopes to be a robust, pure javascript, and easily extended port of\njinja2.\n\n## Installation\n\n`npm install nunjucks`\n\n## Documentation\n\nSee http://nunjucks.jlongster.com/ for complete documentation.",
